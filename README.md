# Textscanner

A new Flutter application.
I was facing this issue of link (URL) being unable to launch from images , in this Covid19 time there are lots of webinars & workshops being conducted . If you find an image with a URL to register it was quite a task to hard type the written URL in the image to the browser & then able to register , sometimes it misspelled & yes it was quite painful experience.

To overcome this, I have build this app "Link Scanner" which grabs the written text in the image with the help of Machine Learning [Text Segmentation] & converts it into URL in the blue color which makes the task quite effortless now you just need to tap on the blue highlighted link .

- Pick an image
- Crop it
- Launch the Link
